Firstly We use the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for formatting and we work to develop with the least dependency. Of course, this does not mean we will develop all our needs ourselves. But we attention somethings when choosing a dependency. These are stability, support, dependency,  support of up-to-date technology.
